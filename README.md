# MineWatch
A MineWatch recreation written in HTML, PHP and CSS. Will probably switch to node.js once I learn it.

# How to use?
There's no real way to use this. You can only check the pages because the camera functionality is still not implemented.
To self host it, use this command:
```
node main.js
```
If you wanna view it without self hosting, you can go [here](https://minewatch.vercel.app).
