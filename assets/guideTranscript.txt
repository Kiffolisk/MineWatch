If you're reading this, you're probably new here. This guide contains all essential information you need to know.
<br>
When you arrive at this site, you may see the <b>Home</b> page, which is the main section of the site when you arrive.
<br>
On the top you can see the header, which contains a welcoming title and hyperlinks to pages.
<br>
You are currently in the <b>"Guide"</b> section, which means you at least know how to navigate hyperlinks, because without that knowledge, you probably won't be here without help.
<br>
Click on the <b>"Cameras"</b> hyperlink. You can see a list of cameras. It is easy to watch them, just click on their specific button / image. The buttons also have the camera ID under them, which is sometimes useful, for example going back to the camera later.
<br>
Remember, if you cannot / don't want to pick, just click on the <b>"Random camera"</b> hyperlink.
<br>
Congratulations! You are now watching a camera. You can see:
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>the statistics</b> (how long the camera was running before you started watching, the ID, and if it's running)</li>
    <li><b>the chat</b> (only if the camera is located in a Multiplayer game)
</ul>
<br>
The main part is the camera feed itself. If no one is there, either go back to the <b>"Cameras"</b> hyperlink and choose another camera, or wait for any activity.
<br>
If you've chosen a Multiplayer camera, there may be more activity than in a Singleplayer camera. You can know if it's a Singleplayer camera if the chat says the player is not in Multiplayer.
<br>
For now, you cannot interact with the chat in any way but to watch. You can refresh the statistics by refreshing the page or by choosing the same camera again.
<br>
